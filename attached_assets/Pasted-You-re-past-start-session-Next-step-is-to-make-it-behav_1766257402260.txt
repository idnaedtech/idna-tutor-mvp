You’re past “start session”. Next step is to make it behave like a **real tutor**: **show the first question and run the full ask → answer → grade → next loop in the UI.**

## Next step (do this now)

### 1) On Start Session, immediately show Question #1

Right now it only shows:

> “Session started. Ready to begin.”

That’s not tutoring yet.

**Change StartSession to also pick the first question and return it**, or call Turn once automatically.

**Best (clean):** In `StartSession()` after creating the session:

* call `get_next_question(student_id, topic_id)`
* save `current_question_id` in `sessions`
* return `tutor_text = question prompt`

So the UI shows the first question instantly.

---

## After that (still MVP-critical)

### 2) Add a text box + Send button for answers

UI must have:

* input box
* Send
* it calls your FastAPI endpoint (ex: `/api/turn`) with:

  * `session_id`
  * `user_text`

Then backend calls gRPC `Turn(...)`.

---

## Must-fix product behavior

### 3) One-turn grading (no “press next”)

You already started fixing this. Confirm final behavior:

* student types answer
* tutor replies **Correct/Wrong immediately**
* if correct → shows next question in same reply
* if wrong → shows hint in same reply

---

## Make progress real (small table, big value)

### 4) Add an `attempts` table (so you can build parent reports later)

Create table:

* `session_id`
* `student_id`
* `topic_id`
* `question_id`
* `user_answer`
* `is_correct`
* `created_at`

Every time the student answers, insert one row.

This is the foundation for:

* progress %
* weak areas
* parent report

## Your “definition of done” for the next step

When you click **Start Session**:

1. You immediately see **Question 1**
2. You answer
3. You immediately see ✅/❌ feedback
4. If ✅ → you immediately see **Question 2**
5. Supabase shows rows in `attempts` (and `seen_questions` updates)

---

If you paste your **FastAPI endpoint for Turn** (the one calling `STUB.Turn`) and your UI JS that handles “Send”, I’ll point to the exact 5–10 lines to change to make “Start Session → Question 1” work.
